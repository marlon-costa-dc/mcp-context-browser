//! Admin Authentication (Stub)
//!
//! Authentication for admin API endpoints.
//! Currently a placeholder - admin endpoints are protected by
//! `auth` module and infrastructure JWT services.
//!
//! Future implementation may add:
//! - Admin-specific authentication policies
//! - API key authentication
//! - RBAC for admin operations
